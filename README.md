This is a simple program for a Secret Santa lottery.

How to use:
-----------

From your OS command line, just run main.py from python command line.

Linux example (with python3, within the same folder):
  python3 main.py


The prompt will ask you to first input how many people are participating.
From there, the script will gather a list of names for each participant.
Afterwards it will pair up names from the list you gave and output who has who as a Secret Santa.


There is a known issue where odd numbered participants may get a result where the last entry is itself.  Working on a fix for this, for now though you can just simply rerun the script again to get a new list.

Why did I make this?
--------------------
I am very new to python, and in the past as the delegated "Secret Santa drawer" for the family, I was looking for an easy way to automate it quickly, and I landed on writing a quick script to do so, and used python to do so to help with my learning. So my code wont be 100 the best, but enough to get the job done at least.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

Thanks!
